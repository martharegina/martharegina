# Hi, I'm Gina!✌️

I like typing on my keyboard (because I can type fast HEHE).
That’s why I started building things aka programming. I use AI because it’s faster when the machine helps me think (brain rot help!!!).

## What I Like
- Building random tools that might be useful  
- Making AI do the boring parts  
- Turning ideas into projects (even unfinished ones count, right?)

✨ Thanks for visiting my corner of the internet!
